# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator âž—

The goal of this project is to create a function that uses Numpy. The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix. If a list containing less than 9 elements is passed into the function, it should raise a ValueError exception with the message: "List must contain nine numbers."
