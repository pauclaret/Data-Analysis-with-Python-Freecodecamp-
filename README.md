# Data Analysis with Python Certification (freeCodeCamp) üêç
Hi! Thanks for visiting my repository üòÉ In this Data Analysis with Python Certification course, made by <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>, I have learned the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. This includes cleaning and preprocessing data to ensure that it is accurate and ready for analysis, how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to process and visualize data, and using the Scipy library in order to make predictions using the avalaible data.

The good thing about this course is that it has given me the opportunity to put my knowledge into practice through the five projects that you can find in this repository. Although you can find out what each one is about if you access them individually, here is a brief summary of each one of them.

### Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
Function that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

### Demographic Data Analyzer
Analysis of demographic data using Pandas. The dataset contains demographic data extracted from the 1994 Census database.

### Medical Data Visualizer
Visualization and calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.

### Page View Time Series Visualizer
Visualization of time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots (made with Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn). The dataset contains the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03.

### Sea Level Predictor
Analysis of a dataset containing the global average sea level change since 1880, using the Scipy library to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
